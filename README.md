# Elephant-Utensil-Holder

An adorable elephant-shaped utensil holder with a trick up it's sleeve - when water runs through the trunk, it makes noise!
My favorite part: the sound board PCB itself is shaped like an elephant! My drawing skills are not great, but I managed to create a cute minamalistic elephant :)
This repo contains the PCB files, component datasheets, sounds for the board, final code and tools, a bunch of example code I ran through while trying to get this to work, 3D models, and some other things I might have forgotten! Feel free to take a look.

Credit to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:998999 for giving me the base upon which to build by own model.

I'm actually rather proud of this one. I learned how to work with the ATtiny402 chip by raeding through the datasheet and whatnot. It was quite fun. And it's very functional as a utensil holder!
